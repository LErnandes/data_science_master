# Data Science Master
## The best lib for a Data Scientist

Data Science Master is a lib for all jobs demand of a data scientist

<p>Extraction, filtering, preprocessing, ploting, machine learning and more</p>

<p>The lib came by the creator's need (Luis Ernandes) to shorten things up, because every project he had to import the same libs, make a lot of iterations and ending up spending too much time making convertions, formatting and stuff like that doing very little of the actual project.</p>
